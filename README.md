# WP Statistics Referral Channels

This project is dedicated to enhancing the [WP Statistics](https://wp-statistics.com/) WordPress plugin by categorizing traffic based on referral URLs.

## Objective

Our aim is to maintain a community-driven repository where users can contribute to and maintain a list of URLs categorized into different channel groups. These lists will help the WP Statistics plugin automatically categorize incoming traffic based on the source of the referral.

## Channel Groups

We manage several channel groups, each represented by a separate text file in the repository. Here are some of the channel groups:

- **[Organic Search](organic_search.txt)** - Traffic from non-ad links in organic-search results.
- **[Organic Video](organic_video.txt)** - Traffic from non-ad links on video sites like YouTube, TikTok, or Vimeo.
- **[Shopping](shopping.txt)** - Traffic from links on shopping sites like Amazon or ebay.
- **[Organic Social](organic_social.txt)** - Traffic from links on social sites like Facebook or Twitter.
- **[Source Channels JSON](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wp-statistics/Referral-Channels@main/source-channels.json)** - JSON file for categorizing traffic sources.


## Contributing

We encourage contributions from the community! Here’s how you can help:

1. **Suggesting New URLs** - If you know a URL that fits into one of our channel groups but isn't listed, please submit a pull request with the URL added to the appropriate text file.

2. **Proposing New Channel Groups** - If you think there's a need for a new channel group, feel free to open an issue to discuss it with the community.

3. **Feedback and Suggestions** - Any feedback on how to improve the categorization process or the plugin’s functionality is always welcome.
